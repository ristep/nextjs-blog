The state of Idaho is home to five federally recognized tribes: the Shoshone-Bannock, the Shoshone-Paiute, the Coeur d'Alene, the Kootenai, and the Nez Perce. These tribes are divided into five distinct groups: the Kutenai (sometimes called Kootenai), Coeur d'Alene, and Nez Perce in the North, the Shoshoni and Northern Paiute in the south.

The Idaho Indians have a rich and diverse culture that dates back thousands of years. They are known for their traditional way of life, which is based on hunting, fishing, and gathering. They also have a strong oral tradition, and their stories and legends have been passed down for generations.

The Idaho Indians have faced many challenges over the years, including the arrival of European settlers and the loss of their traditional lands. However, they have persevered and continue to play an important role in the state of Idaho.

Today, the Idaho Indians are working to preserve their culture and traditions. They are also working to improve their economic opportunities and to ensure that their voices are heard in government.
